I need to add a "tweet id" column to the MindState 
I need to create a tweets table with a "tweet rank" column and a tweet rank function.

Word rank is calculated base on this:

wr = K1 * (freq(w)/base_freq(w)) + K2 * (rank(Author)) + sigma(rank(retweeter)) 

Tweet rank is

tr = sigma(wr(w)) for all words in a tweet.



Word Status values:
0  -> the initial unprocessed state of a word, neutral
-1 -> a word we don't even want to keep a record on in the MindState table, somthing absolutely uninformative
1  -> a word with the least possible significance, or a word which is very common (so it has minimal information)
